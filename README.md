#Goal of project

The project is a web application built using Node.js, Express, and TypeScript that allows users to track their job applications and contacts during the job search process.

The main objective of the project is to provide users with a centralized platform where they can manage and organize their job applications effectively. Users can create, update, and delete job application records, along with associated contact details such as the name, email, and LinkedIn profile of the hiring manager or recruiter.

By using this application, users can keep track of important information related to each job application, such as the position applied for, the company name, application status, application date, and any notes or comments. Additionally, users can maintain a list of contacts they've interacted with during their job search, making it easier to follow up on applications and network with industry professionals.

Overall, the project aims to streamline the job search process and improve the efficiency of managing job applications and contacts, ultimately helping users land their desired job opportunities more effectively.
